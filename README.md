# VisionSite

Welcome to VisionSite! Using a code editor, work through the code prompts in the index.html file to determine your *path moving forward*, complete with inspirational quotes, music, personal goals, and statements of thankfulness. Along the way, you'll learn a little about coding and computer science. After this introduction, you'll be ready to tackle other Codela projects. [Go to Codela](https://codela-k12.github.io/projects/) to find more code-based tools and projects for the English Language Arts classroom.<p>&nbsp;</p>

VisionSite template was designed by University of Pittsburgh students Carter Keith, Domonique Swift, Janet Majekodunmi, and Makye Daniels. It uses inline styling to keep working with code simple. <p>&nbsp;</p>   
    

    
## Get started! 

1. Scroll to the top of this repository and click the green "**Code**" button. Select "**Download ZIP**" to download project files to your local computer. These are all the project files you'll need to get started working with code.

2. Find this project folder in your downloads and move it to a secure place on your local computer or cloud drive. You'll return to this project folder to manage your scripts, images, and other assets. 

3. Download and/or open a code editor. We recommend [Phoenix Code](https://phcode.dev) which runs on a browser or [download](https://phcode.io/#/home) a desktop version. See more information on code editors below (including video tutorials!)   

4. Use the code editor to open the index.html document. Read through the code comments embedded in the index.html document. Here, you'll find all the information you need to work with code!  

5. Once you have modified content in your project folder, you can share  the folder with others. To view a project, simply open the index.html file in a browser window.    


## Publishing to GitHub (optional)

6. You can publish your project to the web using GitHub. GitHub provides a good solution for "free" publishing. [Go to GitHub](https://github.com), sign-in, or create a GitHub account.

7. Once you have an account, create a "**new repository**" to store your files. Click  "**uploading an existing file**" and add ALL of your individual project assets to your repository. After each asset is uploaded, hit "**Commit changes**." 

8. Now you'll need to activate GitHub pages to create a website. In the repository top menu, select "**settings**." A new page will open. In the left-hand menu, select "**Pages**." Change the source setting from "**none**" to "**main**" "**/root**" and then Click "**Save**."

9. Refresh your page after several minutes. GitHub will provide you with a published GitHub URL.

10. Test the URL in a browser. Magic, no? Actually, it's computer science. <p>&nbsp;</p>
